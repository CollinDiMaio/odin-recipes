        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Once you go Instant Pot, there’s just no going back, is there? Especially when it<br> comes to making chicken for dinner, the Instant Pot has made our lives so much easier.<br> This stupid-easy chicken marinara recipe, which has only three ingredients, would be<br> fast even without an Instant Pot. But the recipe and Instant Pot combine to make a<br> dinner that’s so basic and brainless, we barely have words for how do-able this meal is.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 boneless skinless chicken thighs (2lbs)</li>
                <li>2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>24 oz jar of marinara sauce</li>
                <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 cup of polenta</li>
                <li>Flat leaf parsley</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprinkle the chicken thighs all over with 1 teaspoon salt. Add the chicken thighs<br> and marinara to a 6 quart Instant Pot, stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Secure the lid. Choose Pressure Cook on HIGH for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before flipping the valve and<br> releasing the remaining pressure.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, bring the chicken stock to a boil in a medium pot over high heat.<br> Whisk in the polenta, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the<br> polenta is tender and has absorbed all the liquid, about 15 minutes. Stir in<br> remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remove from heat. Let sit for 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Using two forks, shred the chicken in the tomato sauce. Divide the polenta into 6<br> bowls. Serve the chicken and sauce over the polenta, sprinkled with parsley, if<br> using.</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Notes</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If your marinara is thick, add ¼ cup water to prevent a Burn Error on the Instant<br> Pot.</li>
                <li>Polenta will thicken as it sits. If you are not serving it immediately, you can <br>reheat it gently over low heat. Whisking in a little more chicken stock, water or<br> olive oil will make it smooth and creamy again.</li>
            </ol>
