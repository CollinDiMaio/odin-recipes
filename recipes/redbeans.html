            <li>Stir in red beans, chicken stock, hot sauce, bay leaf and sausage; season with salt<br> and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and simmer for 15<br> minutes. Uncover; continue to simmer until reduced, an additional 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Using a wooden spoon, mash beans until slightly thickened, if desired; season with<br> salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
